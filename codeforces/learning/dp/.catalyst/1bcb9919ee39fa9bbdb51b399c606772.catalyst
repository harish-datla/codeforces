There are $$$n$$$ crossroads in the line in the town, and there is either the bus or the tram station at each crossroad.</p><p>The crossroads are represented as a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, where $$$s_i = \\texttt{A}$$$, if there is a bus station at $$$i$$$-th crossroad, and $$$s_i = \\texttt{B}$$$, if there is a tram station at $$$i$$$-th crossroad. Currently Petya is at the first crossroad (which corresponds to $$$s_1$$$) and his goal is to get to the last crossroad (which corresponds to $$$s_n$$$).</p><p>If for two crossroads $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ for all crossroads $$$i, i+1, \\ldots, j-1$$$ there is a bus station, one can pay $$$a$$$ roubles for the bus ticket, and go from $$$i$$$-th crossroad to the $$$j$$$-th crossroad by the bus (it is not necessary to have a bus station at the $$$j$$$-th crossroad). Formally, paying $$$a$$$ roubles Petya can go from $$$i$$$ to $$$j$$$ if $$$s_t = \\texttt{A}$$$ for all $$$i \\le t &lt; j$$$. </p><p>If for two crossroads $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ for all crossroads $$$i, i+1, \\ldots, j-1$$$ there is a tram station, one can pay $$$b$$$ roubles for the tram ticket, and go from $$$i$$$-th crossroad to the $$$j$$$-th crossroad by the tram (it is not necessary to have a tram station at the $$$j$$$-th crossroad).
