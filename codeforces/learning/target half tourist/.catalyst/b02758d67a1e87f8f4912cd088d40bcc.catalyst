He found that number 123 in base 16 consists of two digits: the first is 7 and the second is 11. So the sum of digits of 123 in base 16 is equal to 18.</p><p>Now he wonders what is an average value of sum of digits of the number <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>A</i></span> written in all bases from <span class=\"tex-span\">2</span> to <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>A</i>&#x2009;-&#x2009;1</span>.</p><p>Note that all computations should be done in base 10.
