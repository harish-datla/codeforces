The public key is a long integer which may consist of even a million digits!</p><p>Polycarpus needs to find such a way to cut the public key into two nonempty parts, that the first (left) part is divisible by <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i></span> as a separate number, and the second (right) part is divisible by <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>b</i></span> as a separate number. Both parts should be <span class=\"tex-font-style-underline\">positive</span> integers that have no leading zeros.
