He likes it so much that on the train he falls asleep. </p><p>Once in summer Peter was going by train from city A to city B, and as usual, was sleeping. Then he woke up, started to look through the window and noticed that every railway station has a flag of a particular colour.</p><p>The boy started to memorize the order of the flags&apos; colours that he had seen. But soon he fell asleep again. Unfortunately, he didn&apos;t sleep long, he woke up and went on memorizing the colours. Then he fell asleep again, and that time he slept till the end of the journey.</p><p>At the station he told his parents about what he was doing, and wrote two sequences of the colours that he had seen before and after his sleep, respectively.</p><p>Peter&apos;s parents know that their son likes to fantasize. They give you the list of the flags&apos; colours at the stations that the train passes sequentially on the way from A to B, and ask you to find out if Peter could see those sequences on the way from A to B, or from B to A. Remember, please, that Peter had two periods of wakefulness.</p><p>Peter&apos;s parents put lowercase Latin letters for colours. The same letter stands for the same colour, different letters &#x2014; for different colours.</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The input data contains three lines.
