{"title":"A.

He boasted to a friend Arkady about winning as much as <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>x</i></span> points for his first contest. But Arkady did not believe his friend&apos;s words and decided to check whether Valera could have shown such a result.</p><p>He knows that the contest number <span class=\"tex-span\">300</span> was unusual because there were only two problems. The contest lasted for <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>t</i></span> minutes, the minutes are numbered starting from zero. The first problem had the initial cost of <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i></span> points, and every minute its cost reduced by <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>d</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>a</i></sub></span> points. The second problem had the initial cost of <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>b</i></span> points, and every minute this cost reduced by <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>d</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>b</i></sub></span> points. Thus, as soon as the zero minute of the contest is over, the first problem will cost <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i>&#x2009;-&#x2009;<i>d</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>a</i></sub></span> points, and the second problem will cost <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>b</i>&#x2009;-&#x2009;<i>d</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>b</i></sub></span> points. It is guaranteed that at any moment of the contest each problem has a non-negative cost.</p><p>Arkady asks you to find out whether Valera could have got exactly <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>x</i></span> points for this contest. You should assume that Valera could have solved any number of the offered problems. You should also assume that for each problem Valera made no more than one attempt, besides, he could have submitted both problems at the same minute of the contest, starting with minute <span class=\"tex-span\">0</span> and ending with minute number <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>t</i>&#x2009;-&#x2009;1</span>.
