As a hausmeister of DHBW, Sagheer waits till all students and professors leave the university building, then goes and turns all the lights off.</p><p>The building consists of <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> floors with stairs at the left and the right sides. Each floor has <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>m</i></span> rooms on the same line with a corridor that connects the left and right stairs passing by all the rooms. In other words, the building can be represented as a rectangle with <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> rows and <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>m</i>&#x2009;+&#x2009;2</span> columns, where the first and the last columns represent the stairs, and the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>m</i></span> columns in the middle represent rooms.</p><p>Sagheer is standing at the ground floor at the left stairs. He wants to turn all the lights off in such a way that he will not go upstairs until all lights in the floor he is standing at are off. Of course, Sagheer must visit a room to turn the light there off. It takes one minute for Sagheer to go to the next floor using stairs or to move from the current room/stairs to a neighboring room/stairs on the same floor. It takes no time for him to switch the light off in the room he is currently standing in. Help Sagheer find the minimum total time to turn off all the lights.</p><p>Note that Sagheer does not have to go back to his starting position, and he does not have to visit rooms where the light is already switched off.</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The first line contains two integers <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> and <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>m</i></span> (<span class=\"tex-span\">1&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;<i>n</i>&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;15</span> and <span class=\"tex-span\">1&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;<i>m</i>&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;100</span>) &#x2014; the number of floors and the number of rooms in each floor, respectively.</p><p>The next <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> lines contains the building description.
