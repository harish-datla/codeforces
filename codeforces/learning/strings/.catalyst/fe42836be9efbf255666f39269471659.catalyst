Oh Those Palindromes","contestId":"1063","problemIndex":"A","timeLimit":"2 seconds","memLimit":"256 megabytes","inputFormat":"standard input","outputFormat":"standard output","problemHtml":"<p>A non-empty string is called <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">palindrome</span>, if it reads the same from the left to the right and from the right to the left. For example, &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">abcba</span>&quot;, &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">a</span>&quot;, and &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">abba</span>&quot; are palindromes, while &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">abab</span>&quot; and &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">xy</span>&quot; are not.</p><p>A string is called a <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">substring</span> of another string, if it can be obtained from that string by dropping some (possibly zero) number of characters from the beginning and from the end of it. For example, &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">abc</span>&quot;, &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">ab</span>&quot;, and &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">c</span>&quot; are substrings of the string &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">abc</span>&quot;, while &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">ac</span>&quot; and &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">d</span>&quot; are not.</p><p>Let&apos;s define a <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">palindromic count</span> of the string as the number of its substrings that are palindromes. For example, the palindromic count of the string &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">aaa</span>&quot; is $$$6$$$ because all its substrings are palindromes, and the palindromic count of the string &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">abc</span>&quot; is $$$3$$$ because only its substrings of length $$$1$$$ are palindromes.</p><p>You are given a string $$$s$$$. You can arbitrarily rearrange its characters. You goal is to obtain a string with the maximum possible value of palindromic count.</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100\\,000$$$)&#xA0;&#x2014; the length of string $$$s$$$.</p><p>The second line contains string $$$s$$$ that consists of exactly $$$n$$$ lowercase characters of Latin alphabet.</p>","outSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Output</div><p>Print string $$$t$$$, which consists of the same set of characters (and each characters appears exactly the same number of times) as string $$$s$$$. Moreover, $$$t$$$ should have the maximum possible value of palindromic count among all such strings strings.</p><p>If there are multiple such strings, print any of them.</p>","noteHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Note</div><p>In the first example, string &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">ololo</span>&quot; has $$$9$$$ palindromic substrings: &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">o</span>&quot;, &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">l</span>&quot;, &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">o</span>&quot;, &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">l</span>&quot;, &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">o</span>&quot;, &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">olo</span>&quot;, &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">lol</span>&quot;, &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">olo</span>&quot;, &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">ololo</span>&quot;. Note, that even though some substrings coincide, they are counted as many times as they appear in the resulting string.</p><p>In the second example, the palindromic count of string &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">abccbaghghghgdfd</span>&quot; is $$$29$$$.</p>","sampleTestcases":[{"id":1612202531023,"input":"5\noolol\n","output":"ololo\n"},{"id":1612202531024,"input":"16\ngagadbcgghhchbdf\n","output":"abccbaghghghgdfd\n"}],"submitUrl":"https://codeforces.com/problemset/submit","language":"c++"}
