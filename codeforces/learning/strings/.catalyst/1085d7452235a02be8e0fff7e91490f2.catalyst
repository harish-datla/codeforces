The exchange rate of <span class=\"tex-font-style-underline\">currency you all know</span> against the burle has increased so much that to simplify the calculations, its fractional part was neglected and the exchange rate is now assumed to be an integer.</p><p>Reliable sources have informed the financier Anton of some information about the exchange rate of <span class=\"tex-font-style-underline\">currency you all know</span> against the burle for tomorrow. Now Anton knows that tomorrow the exchange rate will be an even number, which can be obtained from the present rate by swapping exactly two distinct digits in it. Of all the possible values that meet these conditions, the exchange rate for tomorrow will be the maximum possible. It is guaranteed that today the exchange rate is an <span class=\"tex-font-style-underline\">odd</span> positive integer <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span>.
