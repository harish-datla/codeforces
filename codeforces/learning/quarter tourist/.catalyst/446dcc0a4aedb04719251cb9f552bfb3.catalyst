Let <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>A</i></span> be the number of pieces in the largest puzzle that the teacher buys and <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>B</i></span> be the number of pieces in the smallest such puzzle. She wants to choose such <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> puzzles that <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>A</i>&#x2009;-&#x2009;<i>B</i></span> is minimum possible.
