The wall has enough free space so Monocarp can buy a TV set with screen width not greater than $$$a$$$ and screen height not greater than $$$b$$$. Monocarp is also used to TV sets with a certain aspect ratio: formally, if the width of the screen is $$$w$$$, and the height of the screen is $$$h$$$, then the following condition should be met: $$$\\frac{w}{h} = \\frac{x}{y}$$$.</p><p>There are many different TV sets in the shop. Monocarp is sure that for any pair of <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">positive integers</span> $$$w$$$ and $$$h$$$ there is a TV set with screen width $$$w$$$ and height $$$h$$$ in the shop.</p><p>Monocarp isn&apos;t ready to choose the exact TV set he is going to buy. Firstly he wants to determine the optimal screen resolution. He has decided to try all possible variants of screen size. But he must count the number of pairs of <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">positive integers</span> $$$w$$$ and $$$h$$$, beforehand, such that $$$(w \\le a)$$$, $$$(h \\le b)$$$ and $$$(\\frac{w}{h} = \\frac{x}{y})$$$.</p><p>In other words, Monocarp wants to determine the number of TV sets having aspect ratio $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$, screen width not exceeding $$$a$$$, and screen height not exceeding $$$b$$$.
