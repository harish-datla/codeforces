Since Kerem likes it when things are different, he wants all <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">substrings</span> of his string <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i></span> to be distinct. Substring is a string formed by some number of consecutive characters of the string. For example, string &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">aba</span>&quot; has substrings &quot;&quot; (empty substring), &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">a</span>&quot;, &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">b</span>&quot;, &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">a</span>&quot;, &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">ab</span>&quot;, &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">ba</span>&quot;, &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">aba</span>&quot;.</p><p>If string <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i></span> has at least two equal substrings then Kerem will change characters at some positions to some other lowercase English letters. Changing characters is a very tiring job, so Kerem want to perform as few changes as possible.</p><p>Your task is to find the minimum number of changes needed to make all the substrings of the given string distinct, or determine that it is impossible.</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The first line of the input contains an integer <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> (<span class=\"tex-span\">1&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;<i>n</i>&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;100&#x2009;000</span>)&#xA0;&#x2014; the length of the string <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i></span>.</p><p>The second line contains the string <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i></span> of length <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> consisting of only lowercase English letters.</p>","outSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Output</div><p>If it&apos;s impossible to change the string <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i></span> such that all its substring are distinct print <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">-1</span>.
