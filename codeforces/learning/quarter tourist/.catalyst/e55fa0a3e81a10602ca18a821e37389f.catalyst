Then, as soon as the impulse gets back to it&apos;s caster, the wizard reflects it and sends again towards the enemy, without changing the original speed of the impulse.</p><p>Since Harry has perfectly mastered the basics of magic, he knows that after the second collision both impulses will disappear, and a powerful explosion will occur exactly in the place of their collision. However, the young wizard isn&apos;t good at math, so he asks you to calculate the distance from his position to the place of the second meeting of the spell impulses, provided that the opponents do not change positions during the whole fight.</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The first line of the input contains a single integer <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>l</i></span> (<span class=\"tex-span\">1&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;<i>l</i>&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;1&#x2009;000</span>)&#xA0;&#x2014; the length of the corridor where the fight takes place.</p><p>The second line contains integer <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>p</i></span>, the third line contains integer <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>q</i></span> (<span class=\"tex-span\">1&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;<i>p</i>,&#x2009;<i>q</i>&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;500</span>)&#xA0;&#x2014; the speeds of magical impulses for Harry Potter and He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, respectively.</p>","outSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Output</div><p>Print a single real number&#xA0;&#x2014; the distance from the end of the corridor, where Harry is located, to the place of the second meeting of the spell impulses.
