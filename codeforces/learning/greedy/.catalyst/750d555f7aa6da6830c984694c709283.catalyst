Substring Game in the Lesson","contestId":"1220","problemIndex":"C","timeLimit":"2 seconds","memLimit":"256 mebibytes","inputFormat":"","outputFormat":"","problemHtml":"<p>Mike and Ann are sitting in the classroom. The lesson is boring, so they decided to play an interesting game. Fortunately, all they need to play this game is a string $$$s$$$ and a number $$$k$$$ ($$$0 \\le k &lt; |s|$$$).</p><p>At the beginning of the game, players are given a substring of $$$s$$$ with left border $$$l$$$ and right border $$$r$$$, both equal to $$$k$$$ (i.e. initially $$$l=r=k$$$). Then players start to make moves one by one, according to the following rules:</p><p></p><ul></ul><p></p><p></p><li> A player chooses $$$l^{\\prime}$$$ and $$$r^{\\prime}$$$ so that $$$l^{\\prime} \\le l$$$, $$$r^{\\prime} \\ge r$$$ and $$$s[l^{\\prime}, r^{\\prime}]$$$ is lexicographically less than $$$s[l, r]$$$. Then the player changes $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ in this way: $$$l := l^{\\prime}$$$, $$$r := r^{\\prime}$$$.</li><p></p><p></p><li> Ann moves first.</li><p></p><p></p><li> The player, that can&apos;t make a move loses.</li><p></p><p>Recall that a substring $$$s[l, r]$$$ ($$$l \\le r$$$) of a string $$$s$$$ is a continuous segment of letters from s that starts at position $$$l$$$ and ends at position $$$r$$$. For example, &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">ehn</span>&quot; is a substring ($$$s[3, 5]$$$) of &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">aaaehnsvz</span>&quot; and &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">ahz</span>&quot; is not.</p><p>Mike and Ann were playing so enthusiastically that they did not notice the teacher approached them. Surprisingly, the teacher didn&apos;t scold them, instead of that he said, that he can figure out the winner of the game before it starts, even if he knows only $$$s$$$ and $$$k$$$.</p><p>Unfortunately, Mike and Ann are not so keen in the game theory, so they ask you to write a program, that takes $$$s$$$ and determines the winner for all possible $$$k$$$.</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The first line of the input contains a single string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\leq |s| \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) consisting of lowercase English letters.</p>","outSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Output</div><p>Print $$$|s|$$$ lines.</p><p>In the line $$$i$$$ write the name of the winner (print <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">Mike</span> or <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">Ann</span>) in the game with string $$$s$$$ and $$$k = i$$$, if both play optimally</p>","noteHtml":null,"sampleTestcases":[{"id":1612202232007,"input":"abba\n","output":"Mike\nAnn\nAnn\nMike\n"},{"id":1612202232008,"input":"cba\n","output":"Mike\nMike\nMike\n"}],"submitUrl":"https://codeforces.com/problemset/submit","language":"c++"}
