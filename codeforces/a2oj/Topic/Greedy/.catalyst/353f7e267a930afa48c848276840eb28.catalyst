This year he is going to win the International Olympiad in Informatics. But it is not as easy as it sounds: the question Vladik face now is to find the cheapest way to get to the olympiad.</p><p>Vladik knows <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> airports. All the airports are located on a straight line. Each airport has unique id from <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span> to <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span>, Vladik&apos;s house is situated next to the airport with id <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i></span>, and the place of the olympiad is situated next to the airport with id <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>b</i></span>. It is possible that Vladik&apos;s house and the place of the olympiad are located near the same airport. </p><p>To get to the olympiad, Vladik can fly between any pair of airports any number of times, but he has to start his route at the airport <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i></span> and finish it at the airport <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>b</i></span>.</p><p>Each airport belongs to one of two companies. The cost of flight from the airport <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span> to the airport <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>j</i></span> is zero if both airports belong to the same company, and <span class=\"tex-span\">|<i>i</i>&#x2009;-&#x2009;<i>j</i>|</span> if they belong to different companies.</p><p>Print the minimum cost Vladik has to pay to get to the olympiad.</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The first line contains three integers <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span>, <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i></span>, and <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>b</i></span> (<span class=\"tex-span\">1&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;<i>n</i>&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;10<sup class=\"upper-index\">5</sup></span>, <span class=\"tex-span\">1&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;<i>a</i>,&#x2009;<i>b</i>&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;<i>n</i></span>)&#xA0;&#x2014; the number of airports, the id of the airport from which Vladik starts his route and the id of the airport which he has to reach. </p><p>The second line contains a string with length <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span>, which consists only of characters <span class=\"tex-span\">0</span> and <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span>. If the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span>-th character in this string is <span class=\"tex-span\">0</span>, then <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span>-th airport belongs to first company, otherwise it belongs to the second.</p>","outSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Output</div><p>Print single integer&#xA0;&#x2014; the minimum cost Vladik has to pay to get to the olympiad.</p>","noteHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Note</div><p>In the first example Vladik can fly to the airport <span class=\"tex-span\">2</span> at first and pay <span class=\"tex-span\">|1&#x2009;-&#x2009;2|&#x2009;=&#x2009;1</span> (because the airports belong to different companies), and then fly from the airport <span class=\"tex-span\">2</span> to the airport <span class=\"tex-span\">4</span> for free (because the airports belong to the same company). So the cost of the whole flight is equal to <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span>. It&apos;s impossible to get to the olympiad for free, so the answer is equal to <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span>. </p><p>In the second example Vladik can fly directly from the airport <span class=\"tex-span\">5</span> to the airport <span class=\"tex-span\">2</span>, because they belong to the same company.</p>","sampleTestcases":[{"id":1613164888591,"input":"4 1 4\n1010\n","output":"1"},{"id":1613164888592,"input":"5 5 2\n10110\n","output":"0"}],"submitUrl":"https://codeforces.com/problemset/submit","language":"c++"}
