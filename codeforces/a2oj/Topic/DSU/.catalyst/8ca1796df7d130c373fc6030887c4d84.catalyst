Misha and Changing Handles","contestId":"501","problemIndex":"B","timeLimit":"1 second","memLimit":"256 megabytes","inputFormat":"standard input","outputFormat":"standard output","problemHtml":"<p>Misha hacked the Codeforces site. Then he decided to let all the users change their handles. A user can now change his handle any number of times. But each new handle must not be equal to any handle that is already used or that was used at some point.</p><p>Misha has a list of handle change requests. After completing the requests he wants to understand the relation between the original and the new handles of the users.
