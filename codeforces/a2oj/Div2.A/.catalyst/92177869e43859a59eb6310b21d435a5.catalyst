His class has been studying arithmetic expressions. On the last class the teacher wrote three positive integers <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i></span>, <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>b</i></span>, <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>c</i></span> on the blackboard. The task was to insert signs of operations &apos;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">+</span>&apos; and &apos;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">*</span>&apos;, and probably brackets between the numbers so that the value of the resulting expression is as large as possible. Let&apos;s consider an example: assume that the teacher wrote numbers 1, 2 and 3 on the blackboard. Here are some ways of placing signs and brackets:</p><ul> <li> 1+2*3=7 </li><li> 1*(2+3)=5 </li><li> 1*2*3=6 </li><li> (1+2)*3=9 </li></ul><p>Note that you can insert operation signs only between <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i></span> and <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>b</i></span>, and between <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>b</i></span> and <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>c</i></span>, that is, you cannot swap integers. For instance, in the given sample you cannot get expression (1+3)*2.</p><p>It&apos;s easy to see that the maximum value that you can obtain is 9.</p><p>Your task is: given <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i></span>, <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>b</i></span> and <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>c</i></span> print the maximum value that you can get.</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The input contains three integers <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i></span>, <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>b</i></span> and <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>c</i></span>, each on a single line (<span class=\"tex-span\">1&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;<i>a</i>,&#x2009;<i>b</i>,&#x2009;<i>c</i>&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;10</span>).</p>","outSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Output</div><p>Print the maximum value of the expression that you can obtain.</p>","noteHtml":null,"sampleTestcases":[{"id":1613158687008,"input":"1\n2\n3\n","output":"9\n","result":{"id":1613158687008,"stdout":"9\n","stderr":"","exitcode":0,"signal":null,"time":2,"timeout":false}},{"id":1613158687009,"input":"2\n10\n3\n","output":"60\n","result":{"id":1613158687009,"stdout":"60\n","stderr":"","exitcode":0,"signal":null,"time":2,"timeout":false}}],"submitUrl":"https://codeforces.com/problemset/submit","language":"c++","langId":"54"}
