The Robot","contestId":"1468","problemIndex":"K","timeLimit":"2 seconds","memLimit":"512 megabytes","inputFormat":"standard input","outputFormat":"standard output","problemHtml":"<p>There is a robot on a checkered field that is endless in all directions. Initially, the robot is located in the cell with coordinates $$$(0, 0)$$$. He will execute commands which are described by a string of capital Latin letters &apos;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">L</span>&apos;, &apos;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">R</span>&apos;, &apos;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">D</span>&apos;, &apos;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">U</span>&apos;. When a command is executed, the robot simply moves in the corresponding direction:</p><p></p><ul> <li> &apos;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">L</span>&apos;: one cell to the left (the $$$x$$$-coordinate of the current cell decreases by $$$1$$$); </li><li> &apos;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">R</span>&apos;: one cell to the right (the $$$x$$$-coordinate of the current cell is increased by $$$1$$$); </li><li> &apos;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">D</span>&apos;: one cell down (the $$$y$$$-coordinate of the current cell decreases by $$$1$$$); </li><li> &apos;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">U</span>&apos;: one cell up (the $$$y$$$-coordinate of the current cell is increased by $$$1$$$). </li></ul><p></p><p>Your task is to put an obstacle in one cell of the field so that after executing the commands, the robot will return to the original cell of its path $$$(0, 0)$$$. Of course, an obstacle cannot be placed in the starting cell $$$(0, 0)$$$. It is guaranteed that if the obstacle is not placed, then the robot will not return to the starting cell.</p><p>An obstacle affects the movement of the robot in the following way: if it tries to go in a certain direction, and there is an obstacle, then it simply remains in place (the obstacle also remains, that is, it does not disappear).</p><p>Find any such cell of the field (other than $$$(0, 0)$$$) that if you put an obstacle there, the robot will return to the cell $$$(0, 0)$$$ after the execution of all commands. If there is no solution, then report it.</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 500$$$) &#x2014; the number of test cases.</p><p>Each test case consists of a single line containing $$$s$$$ &#x2014; the sequence of commands, which are uppercase Latin letters &apos;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">L</span>&apos;, &apos;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">R</span>&apos;, &apos;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">D</span>&apos;, &apos;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">U</span>&apos; only.
