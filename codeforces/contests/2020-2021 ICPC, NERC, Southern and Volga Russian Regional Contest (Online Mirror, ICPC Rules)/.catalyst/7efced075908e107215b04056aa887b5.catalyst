For example, let $$$s = [1, 2, 5, 7, 2, 3, 12]$$$. After sorting, we get sequence $$$[1, 2, 2, \\underline{3}, 5, 7, 12]$$$, and the median is equal to $$$3$$$.</p><p>You have a sequence of $$$n$$$ integers $$$[1, 2, \\dots, n]$$$ and an <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">odd</span> integer $$$k$$$.</p><p>In one step, you choose any $$$k$$$ elements from the sequence and erase all chosen elements <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">except</span> their median. These elements do not have to go continuously (gaps are allowed between them).</p><p>For example, if you have a sequence $$$[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]$$$ (i.e. $$$n=7$$$) and $$$k = 3$$$, then the following options for the first step are possible:</p><p></p><ul> <li> choose $$$[1, \\underline{2}, 3]$$$; $$$2$$$ is their median, so it is not erased, and the resulting sequence is $$$[2, 4, 5, 6, 7]$$$; </li><li> choose $$$[2, \\underline{4}, 6]$$$; $$$4$$$ is their median, so it is not erased, and the resulting sequence is $$$[1, 3, 4, 5, 7]$$$; </li><li> choose $$$[1, \\underline{6}, 7]$$$; $$$6$$$ is their median, so it is not erased, and the resulting sequence is $$$[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]$$$; </li><li> and several others. </li></ul><p></p><p>You can do zero or more steps.

In other words, there is no way to get sequence $$$b = [1]$$$ as the result. </p><p>In the second test case, you have sequence $$$[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]$$$ and one of the optimal strategies is following: </p><ol> <li> choose $$$k = 3$$$ elements $$$[2, \\underline{3}, 4]$$$ and erase them except its median; you&apos;ll get sequence $$$[1, 3, 5, 6, 7]$$$; </li><li> choose $$$3$$$ elements $$$[3, \\underline{5}, 6]$$$ and erase them except its median; you&apos;ll get desired sequence $$$[1, 5, 7]$$$; </li></ol><p></p><p>In the fourth test case, you have sequence $$$[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]$$$.
