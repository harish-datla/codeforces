{"title":"J. Road Reform","contestId":"1468","problemIndex":"J","timeLimit":"2 seconds","memLimit":"512 megabytes","inputFormat":"standard input","outputFormat":"standard output","problemHtml":"<p>There are $$$n$$$ cities and $$$m$$$ bidirectional roads in Berland. The $$$i$$$-th road connects the cities $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$, and has the speed limit $$$s_i$$$. The road network allows everyone to get from any city to any other city. </p><p>The Berland Transport Ministry is planning a road reform.</p><p>First of all, maintaining all $$$m$$$ roads is too costly, so $$$m - (n - 1)$$$ roads will be demolished in such a way that the remaining $$$(n - 1)$$$ roads still allow to get to any city from any other city. Formally, the remaining roads should represent an undirected tree.</p><p>Secondly, the speed limits on the remaining roads might be changed. The changes will be done sequentially, each change is either increasing the speed limit on some road by $$$1$$$, or decreasing it by $$$1$$$. Since changing the speed limit requires a lot of work, the Ministry wants to minimize the number of changes.</p><p>The goal of the Ministry is to have a road network of $$$(n - 1)$$$ roads with the maximum speed limit over all roads equal to exactly $$$k$$$. They assigned you the task of calculating the minimum number of speed limit changes they have to perform so the road network meets their requirements.</p><p>For example, suppose the initial map of Berland looks like that, and $$$k = 7$$$:</p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/9a40b12261afa72154889e3d786425b614567c7e.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"> </center><p>Then one of the optimal courses of action is to demolish the roads $$$1$$$&#x2013;$$$4$$$ and $$$3$$$&#x2013;$$$4$$$, and then decrease the speed limit on the road $$$2$$$&#x2013;$$$3$$$ by $$$1$$$, so the resulting road network looks like that:</p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/fe7197606205c4f1c89d810b326ee18624d4d042.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"> </center>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$) &#x2014; the number of test cases.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$; $$$n - 1 \\le m \\le \\min(2 \\cdot 10^5, \\frac{n(n-1)}{2})$$$; $$$1 \\le k \\le 10^9$$$) &#x2014; the number of cities, the number of roads and the required maximum speed limit, respectively.</p><p>Then $$$m$$$ lines follow.
