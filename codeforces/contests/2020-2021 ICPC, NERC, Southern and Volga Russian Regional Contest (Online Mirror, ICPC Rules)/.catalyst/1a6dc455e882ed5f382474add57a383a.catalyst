In order not to be spotted by orcs, they decided to go through the mountains.</p><p>The mountain relief can be represented as a polyline with $$$n$$$ points $$$(x_i, y_i)$$$, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ ($$$x_i &lt; x_{i + 1}$$$ for $$$1 \\le i \\le n - 1$$$). Hobbits start their journey at the point $$$(x_1, y_1)$$$ and should reach the point $$$(x_n, y_n)$$$ to complete their mission.</p><p>The problem is that there is a tower with the Eye of Sauron, which watches them. The tower is located at the point $$$(x_n, y_n)$$$ and has the height $$$H$$$, so the Eye is located at the point $$$(x_n, y_n + H)$$$. In order to complete the mission successfully, the hobbits have to wear cloaks all the time when the Sauron Eye can see them, i.&#x2009;e. when there is a direct line from the Eye to the hobbits which is not intersected by the relief.</p><p>The hobbits are low, so their height can be considered negligibly small, but still positive, so when a direct line from the Sauron Eye to the hobbits only touches the relief, the Eye can see them.</p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/c2ceba8771eab88bf02aec0771e0d74442d46974.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\">   <span class=\"tex-font-size-small\">The Sauron Eye can&apos;t see hobbits when they are in the left position, but can see them when they are in the right position.</span> </center><p>The hobbits do not like to wear cloaks, so they wear them only when they can be spotted by the Eye.
