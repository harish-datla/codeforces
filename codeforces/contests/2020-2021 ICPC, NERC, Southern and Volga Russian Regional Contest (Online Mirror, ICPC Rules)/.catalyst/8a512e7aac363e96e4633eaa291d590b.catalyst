These cells are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right.</p><p>There are two people in this corridor, a hooligan and a security guard. Initially, the hooligan is in the $$$a$$$-th cell, the guard is in the $$$b$$$-th cell ($$$a \\ne b$$$). </p><p></p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/df1369f1744d5a3b42b0ff3d74542b15d400c3a7.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\">   <span class=\"tex-font-size-small\">One of the possible situations. The corridor consists of $$$7$$$ cells, the hooligan is in the $$$3$$$-rd cell, the guard is in the $$$6$$$-th ($$$n = 7$$$, $$$a = 3$$$, $$$b = 6$$$).</span> </center><p></p><p>There are $$$m$$$ firecrackers in the hooligan&apos;s pocket, the $$$i$$$-th firecracker explodes in $$$s_i$$$ seconds after being lit.</p><p>The following events happen each second (sequentially, <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">exactly in the following order</span>):</p><p></p><ol> <li> firstly, the hooligan either moves into an adjacent cell (from the cell $$$i$$$, he can move to the cell $$$(i + 1)$$$ or to the cell $$$(i - 1)$$$, and he cannot leave the corridor) or stays in the cell he is currently. If the hooligan doesn&apos;t move, he can light <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">one</span> of his firecrackers and drop it. The hooligan can&apos;t move into the cell where the guard is; </li><li> secondly, some firecrackers that were already dropped may explode. Formally, if the firecracker $$$j$$$ is dropped on the $$$T$$$-th second, then it will explode on the $$$(T + s_j)$$$-th second (for example, if a firecracker with $$$s_j = 2$$$ is dropped on the $$$4$$$-th second, it explodes on the $$$6$$$-th second); </li><li> finally, the guard moves one cell closer to the hooligan. If the guard moves to the cell where the hooligan is, the hooligan is caught. </li></ol><p></p><p>Obviously, the hooligan will be caught sooner or later, since the corridor is finite. His goal is to see the maximum number of firecrackers explode before he is caught; that is, he will act in order to maximize the number of firecrackers that explodes before he is caught.</p><p>Your task is to calculate the number of such firecrackers, if the hooligan acts optimally.</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$) &#x2014; the number of test cases.</p><p>Each test case consists of two lines.
