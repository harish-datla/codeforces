The players are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, so that players $$$i$$$ and $$$i+1$$$ are neighbours (as well as players $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$). Each of them has exactly $$$k$$$ cards, where $$$k$$$ is <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">even</span>. The left neighbour of a player $$$i$$$ is player $$$i - 1$$$, and their right neighbour is player $$$i + 1$$$ (except for players $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$, who are respective neighbours of each other).</p><p>Each turn the following happens: if a player has $$$x$$$ cards, they give $$$\\lfloor x / 2 \\rfloor$$$ to their neighbour on the left and $$$\\lceil x / 2 \\rceil$$$ cards to their neighbour on the right. This happens for all players simultaneously.</p><p>However, one player $$$p$$$ is the impostor and they just give all their cards to their neighbour on the right. You know the number of players $$$n$$$ and the number of cards $$$k$$$ each player has initially, but $$$p$$$ is unknown to you. Your task is to determine the value of $$$p$$$, by asking questions like &quot;how many cards does player $$$q$$$ have?&quot; for an index $$$q$$$ of your choice. After each question all players will make exactly one move and give their cards to their neighbours. You need to find the impostor by asking no more than $$$1000$$$ questions.</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$4 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$, $$$2 \\le k \\le 10^9$$$, $$$k$$$ is even)&#xA0;&#x2014; the number of players and the number of cards.</p>","outSpecsHtml":null,"noteHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Note</div><p>In the example the cards are transferred in the following way:</p><ul> <li> $$$2$$$ $$$2$$$ $$$2$$$ $$$2$$$ &#x2014; player $$$1$$$ has $$$2$$$ cards.</li><li> $$$1$$$ $$$2$$$ $$$3$$$ $$$2$$$ &#x2014; player $$$1$$$ has $$$1$$$ card.</li></ul><p>After this turn the number of cards remains unchanged for each player.</p>","sampleTestcases":[{"id":1612200898933,"input":"4 2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n2\n","output":"? 1\n\n? 1\n\n? 2\n\n? 3\n\n? 4\n\n! 2\n"}],"submitUrl":"https://codeforces.com/contest/1471/submit","language":"c++"}
