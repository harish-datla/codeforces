What the robot does is the following: it iterates over the elements of the array, let the current element be $$$q$$$. If $$$q$$$ is divisible by $$$x$$$, the robot adds $$$x$$$ copies of the integer $$$\\frac{q}{x}$$$ to the end of the array, and moves on to the next element. Note that the newly added elements could be processed by the robot later. Otherwise, if $$$q$$$ is not divisible by $$$x$$$, the robot shuts down.</p><p>Please determine the sum of all values of the array at the end of the process.</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The first input line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 100$$$)&#xA0;&#x2014; the number of test cases.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$, $$$2 \\leq x \\leq 10^9$$$)&#xA0;&#x2014; the length of the array and the value which is used by the robot.</p><p>The next line contains integers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, ..., $$$a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$)&#xA0;&#x2014; the initial values in the array.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of values $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.</p>","outSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Output</div><p>For each test case output one integer&#xA0;&#x2014; the sum of all elements at the end of the process.</p>","noteHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Note</div><p>In the first test case the array initially consists of a single element $$$[12]$$$, and $$$x=2$$$.

After the robot processes the next element, the array becomes $$$[12, 6, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3]$$$, and then the robot shuts down, since it encounters an element that is not divisible by $$$x = 2$$$.
