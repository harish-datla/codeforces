Even-Odd Game","contestId":"1472","problemIndex":"D","timeLimit":"2 seconds","memLimit":"256 megabytes","inputFormat":"standard input","outputFormat":"standard output","problemHtml":"<p>During their New Year holidays, Alice and Bob play the following game using an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers: </p><ul> <li> Players take turns, Alice moves first. </li><li> Each turn a player chooses any element and removes it from the array. </li><li> If Alice chooses <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">even value</span>, then she adds it to her score. If the chosen value is odd, Alice&apos;s score does not change. </li><li> Similarly, if Bob chooses <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">odd value</span>, then he adds it to his score. If the chosen value is even, then Bob&apos;s score does not change. </li></ul><p>If there are no numbers left in the array, then the game ends. The player with the highest score wins. If the scores of the players are equal, then a draw is declared.</p><p>For example, if $$$n = 4$$$ and $$$a = [5, 2, 7, 3]$$$, then the game could go as follows (there are other options): </p><ul> <li> On the first move, Alice chooses $$$2$$$ and get two points. Her score is now $$$2$$$. The array $$$a$$$ is now $$$[5, 7, 3]$$$. </li><li> On the second move, Bob chooses $$$5$$$ and get five points. His score is now $$$5$$$. The array $$$a$$$ is now $$$[7, 3]$$$. </li><li> On the third move, Alice chooses $$$7$$$ and get no points. Her score is now $$$2$$$. The array $$$a$$$ is now $$$[3]$$$. </li><li> On the last move, Bob chooses $$$3$$$ and get three points. His score is now $$$8$$$. The array $$$a$$$ is empty now. </li><li> Since Bob has more points at the end of the game, he is the winner. </li></ul><p>You want to find out who will win if both players play optimally. <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">Note that there may be duplicate numbers in the array</span>.</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$)&#xA0;&#x2014; the number of test cases.
