This problem doesn&apos;t support hacks.</span></p><p>Sphinx&apos;s duty is to guard the city of Thebes by making sure that no unworthy traveler crosses its gates. Only the ones who answer her riddle timely and correctly (or get an acc for short) are allowed to pass. As of those who fail, no one heard of them ever again...</p><p>So you don&apos;t have a choice but to solve the riddle. Sphinx has an array $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ of <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">nonnegative</span> integers <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">strictly smaller</span> than $$$2^b$$$ and asked you to find the maximum value among its elements. Of course, she will not show you the array, but she will give you $$$n$$$ and $$$b$$$. As it is impossible to answer this riddle blindly, you can ask her some questions. For given $$$i, y$$$, she&apos;ll answer you whether $$$a_i$$$ is <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">bigger</span> than $$$y$$$. As sphinxes are not very patient, you can ask at most $$$3 \\cdot (n + b) $$$ such questions.</p><p>Although cunning, sphinxes are honest. Even though the array <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">can change</span> between your queries, answers to the previously asked questions will remain valid.</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, b \\leq 200$$$).
